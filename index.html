                mixtape of his own music, titled nostalgia, ULTRA. His next effort, channel ORANGE, was unveiled in 2012
                to both critical and popular acclaim, and he followed with the back-to-back releases of Endless and

            <h2 class="titulo_artista_um">Drake</h2>
            <p class="descricao_texto"> Drake, original name Aubrey Drake Graham, Canadian rap musician who first gained
                fame as an actor on the acclaimed TV teenage drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation and went on to a
                successful and influential music career.</p>
            <p class="descricao_texto">Drake’s breakthrough came in 2009 with the release of the mixtape So Far Gone and
                its hit single “Best I Ever Had.” A bidding war between labels soon ensued, and Drake ultimately signed
                with Lil Wayne’s Young Money Entertainment, a subsidiary of Cash Money. </p>
            <p class="descricao_texto"> Drake’s fourth studio album, Views (2016), which featured the memorable singles
                “One Dance” and “Hotline Bling.” The former became Spotify’s most-streamed single at the time, and the
                latter garnered Drake two Grammys for best rap song and best rap performance—though in interviews Drake
                insisted that “Hotline Bling” was not a rap song. He stated, “The only category that [the Recording
                Academy] can manage to fit me in is in a rap category, maybe because I’ve rapped in the past or because
                I’m Black.” In 2017 Drake did not submit that year’s release, More Life, for Grammy consideration. The
                record, which Drake called a playlist, brought together different sounds from around the world.</p>
